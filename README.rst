Build a Roman-Numeral calculator in two hours.

The significant thing about this entry is that we didn't take the sane approach,
of converting roman numerals to integers, doing the arithmetic and then converting
them back. Instead, we perform the arithmatic directly on the roman numerals
themselves, which is of course madness.

Thanks (& blame?) go to Harry Percival for insisting that it could be done.
